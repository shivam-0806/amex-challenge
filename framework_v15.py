# === V15: V14 + Net Interest Margin refinement ===
# Insight: Amex earns 24% gross APR but has a "Cost of Funds" (cost to borrow the money)
# For premium cardmembers, Amex's cost of funds in 2023 was ~4-5% (Fed Funds Rate era)
# So Net Interest Margin = 24% APR - 5% Cost of Funds = ~19% NIM
# BUT: the ECL (expected credit loss) also eats into this
# Standard banking formula: NIM = Gross APR - Cost of Funds - Provision for Credit Losses
# Our current formula handles ECL separately so we should use GROSS APR (24%) not NIM
# 
# THE REAL OPPORTUNITY: f17 (Lending Credit Line) vs f18 (Charge Card Line)
# f17 = lending credit line — amount Amex is exposed to on revolving products
# f18 = charge card line — effectively unlimited but proxy for creditworthiness
# Currently: R_credit_line = f17 * 0.0001 (tiny contribution)
# 
# ACTUAL INSIGHT from marginal analysis:
# Marginal IN customers: f17=10,899 (higher credit line)
# Marginal OUT customers: f17=10,483 (lower credit line)
# f17 difference = 415 — meaningful at the margin!
#
# What if f17 signals creditworthiness and we should weight it more?
# A higher credit line = Amex is comfortable extending more credit = less risky = more profitable
